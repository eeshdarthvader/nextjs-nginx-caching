# Next.js handles setting headers for browser caching. For the built static assets at /_next/static/*, the url has a unique build ID in it so the browser cache headers are set to cache forever. If you rebuild the app, the url will be different and so the browser will actually be requesting a different resource.
# However, with the static assets in the static/ directory, there is no build ID. They are just made available at the /static/* path unchanged. Therefore, Next.js sets no-cache headers for these assets so the browser never caches them. If the assets change, the url remains the same so we donâ€™t want our users to have out-of-date assets.
# The problem is that NGINX respects these headers and, therefore, will not actually cache these files by default.
# We can get around this by telling NGINX to ignore the Cache-Control headers from our proxied Next.js app
